# GrubHunt

 This web app allows users to find resturants in their local area.

## How it works

After the user inputs their location information GrubHunt is able to find nearby restaurants within your area by converting the given address into geospatial operations. It then compares the locations to our restaurant database and outputs the restaurants within a 5 mile radius. It's quick and easy to use!
