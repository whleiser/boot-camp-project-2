#GrubHunt
This web app allows users to find resturants in their local area.

##How it works
After the user inputs their location information GrubHunt is able to find nearby restaurants within your area by converting the given address into geospatial operations. It then compares the locations to our restaurant database and outputs the restaurants within a 5 mile radius. It's quick and easy to use!

##Built With
axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

MapQuest - Finding an associated latitude and longitude for a given address.
sequelize - Promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.
geolib - Library to provide basic geospatial operations like distance calculation, conversion of decimal coordinates to sexagesimal and vice versa, etc.
